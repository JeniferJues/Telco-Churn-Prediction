### Project Overview 

**Project Background**

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecommunications company and builds a deep learning model to predict churn probability.



**Tools & Tech**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly)
- PowerBI (Dashboard storytelling)
- Streamlit (Interactive deployment)

**Methodology**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Model Development: TensorFlow
- Evaluation
- Risk Segmentation


**Metadata**

- Data source: Kaggle
- Size:7032 rows x 21 columns
- Features: 21 Features
- Target feature:Churn

**Problem Statement**

Telecommunication companies face significant revenue loss due to customer churn, particularly among subscription-based service users. The challenge lies not only in identifying customers who are likely to leave, but also in understanding the behavioral, contractual, and financial factors driving their decisions. Without a predictive system and clear risk segmentation, businesses struggle to proactively retain high-risk customers and allocate retention resources effectively. Therefore, there is a need for a data-driven solution that can analyze churn patterns, accurately predict churn probability, and translate these insights into actionable strategies to minimize revenue at risk.

**Objectives**

- To identify key drivers influencing customer churn
- To predict which customers are likely to churn
- To Segment customers into actionable risk groups

**Result**

- Model Performance
- Test Accuracy: ~73%
- Loss: 0.5468
- Good generalization on unseen data
- The model balances interpretability and predictive performance.

**Key Findings**
- Month-to-month contract customers show significantly higher churn rates
- Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn
- Electronic check payment method correlates with higher churn
- Short tenure customers are more vulnerable
- High-risk segment contributes the most to potential revenue loss

**Real World Impact**

- Target high-risk customers with retention campaigns
- Minimize revenue loss
- Reduce churn rate
- Make data-driven strategic decisions
- Automate churn prediction in real time
